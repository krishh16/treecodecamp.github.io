# treeCodeCamp 
Hello guys 👾
I'm Krishna Tripathi 🧙 and a pasionate programmer🖥️ , I'm 17 👦 years old and know full-stack web dev, cybersecurity and deep learning.
This is my personal project through which I wanna demonstrate my ability to use the technologies and build real world projects that are being used widely.
In this project, I have tried to make the project as functionally similar to the real organization: freeCodeCamp.
If you do not know about freeCodeCamp, freeCodeCamp is an open source online learning and licencing projects which teaches programming and certifies people on 
completing the project assignments. I have personally used it so I think I would be able to replicate the behaviours as close as I can.
